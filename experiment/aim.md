# Aim: 
Write a program of LED blinking through push button using PIC18 series microcontroller.

# Objective:
The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the use of a PIC18 series microcontroller to control the blinking of an LED through a push button switch. The experiment aims to investigate the functionality of the microcontroller's GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins and how they can be programmed to control the state of an LED based on the state of a push button switch. By the end of the experiment, the participant should have a clear understanding of how to interface a push button switch with a microcontroller and use the microcontroller to control the blinking of an LED.
