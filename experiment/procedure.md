### Procedure

##### Simulator :
- step 1 : Select Input Pin For Switch.
- step 2 : Select Output Pin For LED.
- step 3 : Select Switch Configuration.
- step 4 : Select LED Configuration.
- step 5 : Click on "GENERATE CODE" button to generate code.
- step 6 : Click on "COMPILE" button to compile code.
- step 7 : Click on "EXECUTE" button to execute code and goto mimic.
- step 8 : If you want to download code click on "DOWNLOAD" button.
- step 9 : The MIMIC will open on left side of screen. 
- step 10 : Click on selected output pin terminal(red circle) and click on anode terminal(red circle) for connection of the selected output pin to anode. OR click on anode terminal(red circle) and click on selected output pin terminal(red circle) for connect the anode to selected output pin.
- step 11 : Click on cathode terminal(red circle) and click on resistor terminal(red circle) for connection of cathode to resister. OR click on resistor terminal(red circle) and click on cathode terminal(red circle) for connection of resister to cathode.
- step 12 : Click on selected Input pin terminal(blue circle) and click on switch terminal(blue circle) for connection of the selected input pin to switch terminal. OR click on switch terminal(blue circle) and click on selected input pin terminal(blue circle) for connect the switch terminal to selected input pin.
- step 13 : Click on "Check Connection" button.
- step 14 : If you see alert like "Wrong Connection. Please Try Again." click on "Reset Connection" button and follow step 10,11,12 and 13.
- step 15 : If you see alert like "Connection Established Successfully. Now Click on Switch." Click on Switch.
- step 16 : Output LED is on. now observe the square wave graph.
- step 17 : Click on "REFRESH" button. to Re-executing the experiment.
